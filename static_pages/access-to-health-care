<h1>Access to Health Care</h1>
<p>Access to health services and treatments is an important part of a patient’s care. For those living with Parkinson’s disease today, these factors directly impact symptom management and quality of life. The ability to see a specialist and to pay for medications and care impacts the course of an individual’s disease. The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) supports policies that increase patients’ access to health care services and improve well-being.</p>
<h2>Telemedicine</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is the remote delivery of health care services and clinical information using telecommunications technology, including internet, cellular, wireless, satellite and telephone services.</p>
<p>Access to movement disorder specialists — doctors who have additional training in Parkinson’s disease — is limited in certain areas of the country. Being able to see a physician using a computer, at home or in a local doctor’s office, could improve care for those who cannot travel to a specialist. Studies have shown that telemedicine can reduce hospitalization and keep people living safely and independently for longer.</p>
<p>A bill to expand telemedicine services for individuals covered by Medicare was introduced in 2015 but did not make it out of committee. MJFF will continue to support legislation that increases the remote delivery of health care services for those with limited mobility.</p>
<h2>Government Benefits</h2>
<p>Individuals living with Parkinson’s disease may be eligible for certain government benefits such as Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid or disability services. MJFF will work with legislators to enact policy and establish programs that provide sufficient care and coverage for people with Parkinson’s. The Foundation encourages patients and families to become familiar with these programs and know their rights.</p>
