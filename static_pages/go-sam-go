<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="intro"><strong>You challenged him! And now Michael J. Fox Foundation staff member Sam Fox is preparing to meet that challenge by hitting the road, and the trail, once again. Â </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="intro">In the spring and summer of 2015, Sam will undertake Tour de Fox, an extreme endurance expedition in support of Parkinson's research. In just 3 months, Sam will travel from Maine to Vancourver- passing through all 48 of the lower contiguous United States, biking over 5,000 miles along the route and climbing the highest peak in each state. The goal: Unite and inspire Team Fox members, Foundation supporters and the PD community, and raise $500,000 for Parkinson's research.</p>

<h2>How You can Get Involved</h2>
<p>As he travels, Sam is excited to invite fellow adventurers to join the tour along his route. Whether by joining an official bike or climb event, or just attending the celebratory social gathering at each stop, there's plenty of opportunity to jump on board. Stay tuned for the official route and registration launch in Fall 2014!</p>
