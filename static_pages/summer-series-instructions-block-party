Try a block party on behalf of Team Fox and bring your neighborhood together while supporting a great cause! Check out our tips and tricks below to get started.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>1.</span>
<p><strong>Register:</strong> <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/mjff/site/TRR/TeamFox/TeamFox/1366814297?pg=utype&amp;fr_id=1890" class="orange">Register online</a> as a Team Fox member and create a personalized fundraising page to share your event details and collect donations. Once you register your event, we’ll send you a detailed step-by-step toolkit with an event checklist and helpful materials.</p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong> Pick a date and make a list of the activities you’ll include and the supplies you’ll need. Be sure to check your community’s calendar to avoid conflicting events.</p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Recruit some help:</strong> Have a neighbor with a knack for firing up the grill or a friend who loves designing invitations? Ask them to lend a hand! Local businesses can be a great resource, too-- consider asking a local deli to donate some sandwiches or finding a vendor to come out to scoop sno-cones for a few hours.</p>
</li>
<li><span>4.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Don’t forget to include some fun touches to keep everyone entertained. An arts and crafts table or scavenger hunt can be great for the kids whereas themed costume contests or water balloon tosses get the whole family in on the action!</p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Send invitations to your neighbors so they can plan ahead and bring their friends. Remind everyone that even if they can’t attend, they can support you by donating to your Team Fox page.</p>
</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Grab a slice of watermelon:</strong> Seriously, you’ve earned it! Enjoy your big day knowing that you’ve helped Team Fox get one step closer to finding a cure for Parkinson’s.</p>
</li>
<li><span>7.</span>
<p><strong>Share your success:</strong> Held an awesome event? We want to hear about it! Be sure to write up a quick recap and send us some photos to be entered to win a Team Fox Summer Prize Pack! On social media? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamfox" class="orange">Friend us on Facebook</a> and share your updates on Twitter using the hashtag: #TeamFoxSummer</p>
