<h1>Team Fox Young Professionals</h1>
<p><span>The Team Fox Young Professionals (YPs) include regional groups of 20- and 30-somethings who want to support the Foundation’s mission. Our groups in New York, San Francisco and Chicago are comprised of active young adults—some with a personal connection to Parkinson’s disease and some who just want to make a difference. They decided to band together to raise funds and awareness for Team Fox by hosting a variety of events each year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>New York City <o:p></o:p></span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Our first YP group, the New York City Young Professionals, started in 2009. The dedication of its more than 50 members have led to many annual events, including a Sunday Funday, a Fall Gala and a Holiday Party. As the group itself grows, so do their events.

<p><span>The Chicago Young Professionals celebrated their first event, “Party Like A Fox,” in June 2012.
