Organize a charity game or tournament on behalf of Team Fox and challenge your teammates to get out and get active in support of a great cause! Check out some of our tips and tricks below to get started.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>1.</span>
<p><strong>Register:</strong> <a href="/get-involved/create-an-event.php" class="orange">Register online</a> as a Team Fox member and create a personalized fundraising page to share your event details and collect donations. Once you register your event, we’ll send you a detailed step-by-step toolkit with an event checklist and helpful materials.</p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong> From soccer and basketball to informal field games, the possibilities are endless. Finalize your game of choice and determine how to include both team and individual participation. Remember to set a fundraising goal and decide how you’ll sell tickets or ask for donations.</p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Outline the details:</strong> Pick a date and location. Be sure to check your community’s calendar to avoid conflicting events and see what spaces may be available for you to reserve. Consider local parks, school fields or community center gyms.</p>
</li>
<li><span>4.</span>
<p><strong>Recruit some help:</strong> Keep a list of the supplies you’ll need. Identify friends, businesses or rec leagues that might be able to help get materials gathered or donated.</p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Bring more fun to your event by including a decorate-your-own jersey contest, different prize categories or ways for teams to earn special “bonus” points.</p>
</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Post flyers around school and email invites to friends and classmates. Remember to include a link to your Team Fox page so that even if guests can’t attend or participate, they can still show support with a donation.</p>
</li>
<li><span>7.</span>
<p><strong>Celebrate your success:</strong> Consider adding a post-event cookout or hot cider social to cap off what will have been a great day in support of Team Fox!</p>
</li>
<li><span>8.</span>
