<p><strong>The Michael J. Fox Foundation Mark on Therapeautic Development</strong><span style="font-size: 10px;"><br /></span></p>
<p>The Michael J. Fox Foundation exists to speed development of a Parkinson's disease cure and new treatments to improve quality of life for patients until the cure is found. Below we outline some drugs in the pipeline that we’ve supported — what researchers hope they do and where they are in the testing process. Click on the drug/compound name for more information and to learn about the role MJFF has played in its journey toward pharmacy shelves.</p>
