<h1>Smell Survey</h1>
<p>Dear friend,</p>
<p>Researchers around the world are conducting a study that may have a major impact on identifying people who are at risk to develop brain diseases with aging. Family members of individuals who have these conditions can benefit from advances in science that allow early detection.  Identifying who may be at risk in the earliest stages could be important for the development of new therapies that could slow or stop the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>The Michael J. Fox Foundation is on the forefront of research, leading a study to develop screening tools to help us identify who may be at risk for these diseases.  This study will test the connection between sense of smell and Parkinson’s since prior research suggests that smell testing may be an important part of screening for neurologic conditions. </p>
<p>The success of this initiative rests on the willingness of individuals like you. On behalf of the millions of people fighting a battle against neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, thank you for stepping up.</p>
