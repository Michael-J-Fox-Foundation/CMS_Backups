Once you register your event, we’ll send you a detailed step-by-step toolkit with an event checklist and helpful materials.</p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong> Finalize your menu of treats. From homemade lemonade and baked goods to sno-cones and frozen popsicles, the sky is the limit! Have a long list of ingredients? Consider asking your neighborhood grocery or corner store to support your efforts by donating some supplies.</p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Nail down the details:</strong> Pick a date, location and team to help you on the day of your event. Consider setting up shop at a sibling’s baseball game, outdoor concert or community carnival where lots of potential customers will be excited to support you!</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Get your finances in order:</strong> Determine whether you’ll price out your goods individually, ask patrons to determine their own price, collect donations with a tip jar, or some combination of all three!</p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Make your stand extra fun by giving your treats a theme, including lots of Team Fox colors (red and orange) or making a prize wheel for customers to spin.</p>
</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Decorate festive posters to hang and direct customers to your stand, or have friends spread the word with printed flyers (including a link to your Team Fox URL) so guests can show support by making an online donation.</p>
