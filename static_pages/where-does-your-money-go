<h1>Where Does Your Money Go?</h1>
<p>At The Michael J. Fox Foundation, we demand the same accountability and transparency of ourselves as of our awardees, and we keep a tight rein on expenses. Fiscal responsibility and transparency are core values, particularly in how we spend supporters’ contributions. </p>
<p>We deliberately hold no endowment or excessive reserves, instead seeking to deploy funds raised as quickly and wisely as possible. This is an unusual position for a nonprofit. But we believe that to find a cure for Parkinson’s as quickly as possible, our capital needs to push research forward today — not collect interest in a bank account.</p>

<h2>We’re Obsessed with Efficiency</h2>
<p>We are proud that since inception, 89 cents of every dollar spent has gone straight to our research programs effort. Just as important is our philosophy about how to spend the money. We prioritize the projects closest or most critical to practical relevance in patients’ lives. We are outcomes-focused, incorporating milestones into every award and tying grant payments to achievements of those milestones. We work with awardees to troubleshoot and tackle problems as they arise, but if the science stalls, we halt funding so that limited resources can be reallocated to other efforts.</p>

<h2>Our Funding Decisions Give Patients a Seat at the Table</h2>
<p>Our goal is to represent the patient experience of Parkinson’s disease in the biomedical research enterprise. This requires us to maintain the expertise to assess and nimbly reprioritize the most promising projects in an evolving research landscape. Our staff of MD- and PhD-trained neuroscientists and business-trained project leaders lies at the heart of our unusual approach to research funding. While we routinely call on the opinions of experts and advisors from around the globe, ultimately our funding decisions are our own, and each is measured against the same bar: its potential to speed delivery of medical breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s patients.</p>
