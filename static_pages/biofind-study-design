<h2>About the Study</h2>
<p>Launched in 2012, BioFIND is a collaboration between MJFF and the <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/" style="color: orange;" target="_blank">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</a>. The study aims to complement <a href="http://www.ppmi-info.org/" style="color: orange;">PPMI </a>to produce the most comprehensive and long-ranging dataset available for biomarker discovery work throughout the PD community. BioFIND has built a dynamic infrastructure comprised of the principal investigator, site investigators, Clinical Core, Biorepository Core and Bioinformatics Core.  This section of the website is designed to provide insight into the study design and to provide access to primary study documents.<br /><br /><span>BioFIND was designed with a strong focus on developing standardized protocols, policies, systems and processes. To achieve successful implementation of this across the clinical sites and cores, the study leadership has led the development of an extensive study protocol, data collection standards and processes, and data and biospecimen use agreements and policies. All of these documents support the collection, transfer and storage of clinical data and biological samples.</span></p>
