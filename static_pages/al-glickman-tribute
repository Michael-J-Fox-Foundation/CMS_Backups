<p style="margin-top: 20px;">The Michael J. Fox Foundation mourns the passing of philanthropist and Foundation Board member Albert B. Glickman. He died on April 27, 2013, at age 79. Services will be held on May 1 in Portland, Maine.</p>
<blockquote>Al gave us all hope a cure for Parkinson’s is within our reach, and the chutzpah to go after it.”</blockquote>
<p class="citation">— Michael J. Fox of the Glickman family’s extraordinary support of The Michael J. Fox Foundation.</p>
<p>Mr. Glickman joined MJFF’s Board of Directors in 2004, not long after he and his wife, Judy, made their first gift to the Foundation. “Al loved being a catalyst, helping our Foundation connect the dots,” recalls MJFF Co-Founder and Executive Vice Chairman Deborah W. Brooks. “He took delight in setting his own bar high and in inspiring others to do the same. The entire Glickman family carried the banner for the Foundation.” </p>
<p>A native of Portland, Maine, Mr. Glickman rose from humble beginnings to become a pioneer in commercial real estate in California and the western United States. He channeled his professional success to serve others, as a noted philanthropist for artistic, civic and educational causes across the country with a particular emphasis on causes in Maine and California. But his greatest passion was reserved for Judy, his wife of 54 years, and their family, which today includes four children and 18 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Following his own Parkinson’s diagnosis, in the final decade of his life Mr. Glickman was devoted to advancing the work of The Michael J. Fox Foundation. “Al took great pride in his service on our Board,” says MJFF CEO Todd Sherer, PhD. “He was so generous to our Foundation, sharing his strategic acumen, kind spirit and financial resources to speed a cure for his fellow Parkinson’s patients. His presence will be deeply missed.”  </p>
