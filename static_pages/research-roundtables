<h1>Research Roundtables</h1>
<h2>THE FOX FOUNDATION COMES TO YOU</h2>
<p>The Michael J. Fox Foundation offers high-quality educational programs to help you stay informed about research progress in Parkinson’s disease — and how you can help achieve a cure in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Up to eight Research Roundtables annually offering conversation and community in cities across the United States (and sometimes Canada). These in-depth panel discussions cover topics that matter most to patients and their loved ones to help you stay up to date on our urgent pursuit of medical breakthroughs. Every Roundtable also devotes ample time to audience Q&amp;A so that you can submit your own question to our expert panel. These gatherings also offer an opportunity to meet members of the Foundation staff and the broader Parkinson’s community where you live.</p>
<p>Roundtables are hosted by <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/leaders.html?patient-council#davidiverson" style="color: orange;">Dave Iverson</a>, a Parkinson’s patient, veteran journalist and contributing editor to The Michael J. Fox Foundation.</p>
<p>All Michael J. Fox Foundation educational initiatives are offered free of charge. We hope you’ll join us soon.</p>
