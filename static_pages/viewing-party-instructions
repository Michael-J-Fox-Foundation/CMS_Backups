Fox Foundation family in celebrating this momentous and unique event by hosting your viewing party as a Team Fox fundraiser! Check out some of our tips and tricks below to get started:</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>1.</span>
<p><strong>Register:</strong> <a href="/get-involved/create-an-event.php" class="orange">Register online as a Team Fox member</a> using <strong>discount code: PARTY</strong> and create a personalized fundraising page to share your event details and collect donations. <strong>Once you register your event, you’ll have access to all our Team Fox fundraising materials and support.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Plan your fundraiser: </strong> Determine whether you’ll set a price for admission, ask patrons to make a donation at the door, decorate popcorn buckets to collect donations throughout the night — or some combination of all three.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong>Providing donors with a suggested donation amount is often helpful.</em></p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Get sponsors:</strong> Reach out to local businesses to provide food, beverages or raffle prizes for your party. Or request a financial donation in exchange for promoting their business at your event.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong> Creating an event sponsorship package is an excellent way to show businesses the benefits of supporting your event while incentivizing involvement. The Team Fox Handbook located in your online participant center can help you get started.</em></p>
</li>
<li><span>4.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Send invitations for your fundraising party to friends, family, co-workers and neighbors using our branded email template. Also consider adding a posting to your community and school event calendars and asking friends to spread the word through their personal and professional networks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong> Remember to include a link to your Team Fox page so that even if guests can’t attend, they can still support with a donation.</em></p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Create raffles:</strong> Selling raffle tickets for prizes or a 50/50 raffle are an easyway to raise some extra funds the night of your event.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong> Looking to include some extra Team Fox gear to your prize list? Don’t forget to swing by <a href="http://shop.michaeljfox.org/" style="color: orange;">shop.michaeljfox.org</a> to check out some specialty merchandise like campaign t-shirts, bracelets and more.

</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Host games:</strong> Ask guests to make a donation to enter trivia or bingo games. Offer prizes for winners throughout the night.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip: </strong> Up the stakes by allowing guests to form teams, adding a time limit to the trivia competition or offering a bonus round with fun additions of your own!</em></p>
</li>
<li><span>7.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Brainstorm additional ways to engage guests of all ages. Consider adding a theme to your party, entertain guests with Michael J. Fox shows or movies prior to the debut or set up a photo booth with props for guests to document their night. Be sure to check out our online Party Planner for additional ideas.</p>
