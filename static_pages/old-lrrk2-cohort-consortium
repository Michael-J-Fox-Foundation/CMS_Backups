<h1>LRRK2 Cohort Consortium</h1>
<p>The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) is pioneering <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/research/priority-area-detail.php?lrrk2" style="color: orange;" target="_blank;">an innovative approach around the LRRK2 gene</a> in an effort to streamline and orchestrate drug development against this promising target for Parkinson's disease (PD) drug development.  The MJFF-led LRRK2 Cohort Consortium brings research groups together early on – sharing resources, troubleshooting common problems, and identifying best resources – to speed collective efforts to move LRRK2 toward practical therapeutic relevance for patients. </p>
<p>The Consortium follows standardized data acquisition protocols to ensure that tests and assessments conducted at multiple sites can be pooled. Cross-sectional data and samples acquired from study participants are included in a comprehensive Parkinson's database and bio-repository, which is available to the scientific community to conduct research on novel PD biomarkers and will be updated on a quarterly basis throughout the duration of the study. The Consortium aims to complement PPMI to produce a comprehensive dataset available for biomarker discovery work throughout the PD community.</p>
