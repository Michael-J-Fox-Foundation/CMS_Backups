<h2 style="clear: both;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>1.</span>
<p><strong>Register:</strong> <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/mjff/site/TRR/TeamFox/TeamFox/1366814297?pg=utype&amp;fr_id=1890" class="orange">Register online</a> as a Team Fox member and create a personalized fundraising page to share your event details and collect donations. Once you register your event, we’ll send you a detailed step-by-step toolkit with an event checklist and helpful materials.</p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong> Think about what sort of activities would work best with the age groups involved. From potato sack races and water balloon tosses to a family kickball or capture the flag tournament, the possibilities are endless! Remember to set a fundraising goal and determine how you’ll sell tickets and/or ask for donations.</p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Nail down the details:</strong> Pick a date and location. Be sure to check your community’s calendar to avoid conflicting events and see what outdoor space may be available for you to reserve—with school out for the summer, there are likely some large and convenient spaces nearby!</p>
</li>
<li><span>4.</span>
<p><strong>Recruit some help:</strong> Keep a list of the supplies you’ll need. Identify friends or businesses that might be able to help get materials gathered or donated.</p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Bring additional fun to your field day by including a creative costume contest, different prize categories or ways for teams to earn special "bonus" points.</p>
</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Email invites to friends, post flyers around town and ask neighbors to tell their friends. Remember to include a link to your Team Fox page so that even if guests can’t attend, they can still support with a donation.</p>
</li>
<li><span>7.</span>
<p><strong>Celebrate your success:</strong> Consider adding a post-event cookout or ice cream social to cap off what will have been a great day in support of Team Fox!</p>
</li>
<li><span>8.</span>
