<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong>: Finalize the structure of your Penny War (we’ll send you some suggestions once you register!) and determine the number of teams you will have. Remember to recruit a few key players to act as team captains and help excite others to join.</p>

<p><strong>Get your finances in order:</strong> Compile a list of materials that you will need throughout your campaign.

<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Hang flyers around town, add a posting Include mention in your local school bulletin and have teachers build anticipation by starting a countdown on their chalkboards.
