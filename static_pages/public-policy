<h1>Public Policy</h1>
<p>Government policies have a direct effect on the scope of Parkinson's disease (PD) care and research. The federal government is the largest funder of PD research, approves new PD drugs to ensure they are safe and effective and helps people with Parkinson's access services that can increase quality of life.</p>
<p>The Michael J. Fox Foundation advocates for government policies that accelerate the development of Parkinson's therapies and reduce barriers to care and support services. The Foundation works to educate government leaders on patient needs and represents the patient voice in conversations with federal agencies, drug developers and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Historically, the Parkinson's Action Network (PAN) served as the unified voice of the PD community on public policy and advocacy issues. Key PAN staff and programs transitioned to MJFF in June 2016 to advance this important work.</p>
<p><img src="/files/pan.png" style="float: left; width: 230px; padding: 30px;" />PAN, which was founded in 1991 by Joan Samuelson, helped to increase federal funding for PD research and expand physical, occupational and speech-language therapy services for people with PD. The organization also worked to enact legislation that created the Morris K. Udall Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research, among other contributions.</p>
<p>Through its unification with PAN, MJFF will lead a cohesive research and policy effort to bring new treatments to market quickly and increase quality of life. To learn more about MJFF's public policy work, explore the additional resources on this page and read our FAQs below.</p>

<div class="clearit"></div>
</div>
<div id="info-info2-155" class="info-info" style="display: none;">
<p>Since MJFF launched in 2000, the landscape of Parkinson's disease drug development has evolved significantly. At launch, Parkinson's research as a whole lay primarily in basic research and few promising drug candidates were advancing toward clinical testing. Today, more PD drug candidates are reaching late-stage clinical testing and entering complex regulatory and reimbursement approval processes. For some untreated symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as cognitive decline, regulatory pathways may not yet exist.</p>
<p>Further, government funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — U.S. taxpayers' vehicle to finance basic scientific and medical research — does not match current research needs. The NIH is the largest funder of PD research, and changes to its budget put more responsibility on private companies for discovery and validation.</p>
<p>MJFF is uniquely positioned to represent the patient voice in conversations among companies, regulators and payers — helping to tee up “win-wins” for Parkinson's drug makers and patients by ensuring all aspects of therapeutic development are informed by the most critical unmet needs of those living with the disease.</p>

<div id="info-info2-6" class="info-info" style="display: hidden;">
<p>MJFF is in <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/files/The-Future-of-Parkinsons-Public-Policy-FINAL-WHITE-PAPER.pdf">a continuing dialogue with the Parkinson's community</a> to ensure the Foundation's work reflects the top concerns of patients, families and caregivers.</p>
<p>The community identified increased federal scientific research funding and an efficient government approval process for new therapies as top priorities. Many expressed concern about the costs of medications, long-term care and therapy services. Additionally, enhancements to disability policy and veterans benefits, as well as programs such as telemedicine, are areas of focus.</p>
<p>MJFF will continue to evaluate and prioritize programs as patient priorities evolve.</p>

<div id="info-info2-3" class="info-info" style="display: hidden;">
<p>PAN's grassroots volunteers have been essential to strengthening local support for policies that benefit patients. This program continues under MJFF. A committee comprising members of this community will give patients a seat at the table and help shape MJFF's advocacy efforts.</p>
<p>MJFF will also continue the annual D.C. Forum, during which grassroots volunteers meet with their members of Congress to advocate for important Parkinson's policy initiatives.</p>
