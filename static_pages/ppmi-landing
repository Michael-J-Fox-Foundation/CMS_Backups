<h2>Study Overview</h2>
<p>The Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a landmark clinical study to better understand the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The goal of PPMI is to identify and assess biomarkers, objective measures of Parkinson’s disease in people who have PD, people who do not have PD and groups of people who may be at risk to develop PD.</p>
<p><b>PPMI is currently recruiting a new group of participants who may be at risk for PD to understand progression of biomarkers even before PD symptoms occur. </b> Early detection is crucial to understanding the causes of PD and developing better treatments for Parkinson’s disease. Friends and family of people with Parkinson’s can play a unique role in this research. People over 60 who do not have Parkinson’s are needed for this study, which is being conducted at 22 PD centers across the United States and in Europe.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible to enroll in PPMI?</h2>
<p>People over 60 who have <b><u>not</u></b> been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease are eligible. Once a volunteer provides consent to participate, evaluations and assessments will be conducted to determine eligibility. </p>

<h2>What are the key risk factors that PPMI will investigate?</h2>

<h3><a href="/page.html?ppmi-smell">Hyposmia/Smell Loss</a></h3>
<p>While most people with a reduced sense of smell will not develop Parkinson’s disease, loss or reduction of the ability to smell is common in people with PD. Get involved by taking the <a href="/get-involved/smellsurvey.php">smell survey</a> or call (877) 525-PPMI.</p>

<h3><a href="/page.html?ppmi-genetics">LRRK2 Gene Mutation</a></h3>
<p>To date, about 10 percent of Parkinson’s disease cases have been linked to a genetic cause, the most common of which is a mutation in the LRRK2 gene.</p>

<h3><a href="/page.html?ppmi-sleep">REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)</a></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that people with RBD are at increased risk of developing neurological conditions including PD. PPMI is seeking people with RBD who do not have Parkinson’s disease and are over 60. </p>
