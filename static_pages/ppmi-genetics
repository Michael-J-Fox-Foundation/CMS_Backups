<h1>The Role of Genetics in PD Research</h1>
<p>It is extremely valuable to study people who carry a PD-related genetic mutation, even if they don’t have PD. Research studies of these individuals could have important implications for all people with Parkinson’s disease, not just those with genetic forms of the disease. </p>
<p>The Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a landmark clinical study to better understand the progression of Parkinson’s disease. The goal of PPMI is to identify and assess biomarkers, or indicators of Parkinson’s disease progression, to ultimately enable early and accurate detection of PD and potentially help identify new and better treatments for future generations of PD patients.</p>
<p>For people of particular ethnic backgrounds, mutations in LRRK2 are more common. PPMI seeks to provide genetic testing and counseling at no charge to individuals with and without PD who may be carriers of a LRRK2 mutation. Individuals who carry the mutation may be invited to participate in additional tests and evaluations as part of PPMI.</p>
