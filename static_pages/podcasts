<p><a href="/foundation/leaders.html?research-programs#brianfiske">Brian Fiske</a>, PhD, vice president of research programs, explains the challenges of developing a so-called “disease-modifying” Parkinson's treatment — one that goes beyond symptom relief to actually slow or stop progression of the disease — and discusses why mixed results from clinical testing of Azilect (rasagiline) make it hard to know whether that drug is in fact disease-modifying.</p>

<h3>Deep Brain Stimulation: Right for More Parkinson's Patients than Once Was Thought?</h3>

<p>Parkinson's patients Anthony Farinella, 62, and Ian Pearson, 60, discuss their experience with Parkinson's and their decision to undergo Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS pioneer <a href="/foundation/leaders.html?scientific-advisors#andreslozano">Andres Lozano</a>, MD, PhD, reports on preliminary study results indicating that the benefits of DBS endure over the long term — results that, if validated, could lead to more patients being treated with DBS earlier in the course of their disease.</p>

<h3>CoQ10: Does It Protect the Neurons that Die in Parkinson's Disease? Unfortunately, Research Says No</h3>
<div class="audioContainer"><audio src="http://podcast.michaeljfox.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/MJ-CoQ10-Study.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></div>
<p>Controlled clinical research has not demonstrated any ability of natural supplement coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to slow progression of Parkinson's disease, but many patients believe in its power and continue to take the supplement. Doctors say there is likely no harm in taking CoQ10, but unfortunately no benefit either.</p>
