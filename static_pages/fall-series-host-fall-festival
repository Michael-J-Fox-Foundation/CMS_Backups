Organize a fall festival and bring out your school or community for a day of fun in support of Team Fox! Check out some of our tips and tricks below to get started.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>1.</span>
<p><strong>Register:</strong> <a href="/get-involved/create-an-event.php" class="orange">Register online</a> as a Team Fox member and create a personalized fundraising page to share your event details and collect donations. Once you register your event, we’ll send you a detailed step-by-step toolkit with an event checklist and helpful materials.</p>
</li>
<li><span>2.</span>
<p><strong>Start planning:</strong> : Think about what sort of activities would work best with the age groups involved. From bobbing for apples and decorating pumpkins to an apple pie bake-off or a ring toss competition, the possibilities are endless! Remember to set a fundraising goal and determine how you will sell tickets or ask for donations..</p>
</li>
<li><span>3.</span>
<p><strong>Outline the details:</strong> Pick a date and location and be sure to check your community’s calendar to avoid conflicting events. Consult local boards to see what outdoor space may be available for you to reserve such as a school parking lot or a community park.</p>
</li>
<li><span>4.</span>
<p><strong>Recruit some help:</strong> Keep a list of the supplies you’ll need. Identify friends or businesses that might be able to help get materials gathered or donated. Consider soliciting local youth groups or scout troupes to fulfill community service requirements by helping staff the event.</p>
</li>
<li><span>5.</span>
<p><strong>Utilize local business:</strong> Keep event costs low by asking local businesses and restaurants to donate food, supplies and services. <br /> <em>*Fundraising Tip: Creating an event sponsorship package is a great way to both outline the benefits of supporting your event while incentivizing involvement!</em></p>
</li>
<li><span>6.</span>
<p><strong>Get creative:</strong> Bring more fun to your festival by including a themed raffle, a photo booth with props or live entertainment from a local band.</p>
</li>
<li><span>7.</span>
<p><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Hang flyers around town, add a posting to your community and school event calendars and ask friends to share with their networks. Remember to include a link to your Team Fox page so that even if guests can’t attend, they can still support with a donation.</p>
