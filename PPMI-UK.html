<h2>ABOUT PPMI</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a landmark study launched in 2010 to find biomarkers — disease indicators that are critical missing links in the search for better Parkinson’s disease (PD) treatments. Today, only treatments that temporarily alleviate symptoms are available to people with Parkinson's. Discovering biomarkers through PPMI would give researchers a critical tool in the quest for disease-modifying therapies (those that can slow or stop the progression of the disease). PPMI is taking place at 32 PD centers worldwide, including Imperial College London.</p>

<p>The success of PPMI depends on finding more volunteers with and without Parkinson's disease. Click your status to get started today.</p>

<p>At PPMI's 32 clinical sites in 13 countries, nearly 800 participants — everyday patients and their loved ones — are contributing invaluable data and biosamples into the most robust Parkinson's database and specimen bank ever created. These resources are paired with a simple online system allowing researchers to access study data and samples for complementary PD research in their own labs across the globe. Because PPMI is an observational study, research volunteers do not take any experimental drug or placebo, but agree to contribute data and samples for up to five years. A $60-million study, PPMI is sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation and funded by the Foundation in partnership with 15 biotech and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
